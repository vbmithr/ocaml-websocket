"\| The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client
"\| running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host
"\| that has opted-in to communications from that code.
"\|
"\| The security model used for this is the origin-based security model
"\| commonly used by web browsers. The protocol consists of an opening
"\| handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP.
"\|
"\| The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for
"\| browser-based applications that need two-way communication with
"\| servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g.,
"\| using XMLHttpRequest or <iframe>s and long polling).
