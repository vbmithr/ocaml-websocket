(** Module [Websocket_async]: websocket library for Async *)

(** This module implements a websocket client and server library in
    the spirit of the otherwise similar TCP functions of the [Lwt_io]
    module. The websocket protocol add message framing in addition of
    simple TCP communication, and this library implement framing and
    unframing of messages.

(** [server ?log ?random_string ?request_cb reader writer app_to_ws
    ws_to_app ()] returns a thread that expects a websocket client
    connected to [reader]/[writer] and, after performing the
    handshake, will resp. read outgoing frames from [app_to_ws] and
    write incoming frames to [ws_to_app]. The thread is determined if
    any of [reader], [writer], [app_to_ws], [ws_to_app] is closed. If
    case of an error, [app_to_ws] and [ws_to_app] will be closed. Upon
    reception of the client HTTP request, [request_cb] will be called
    with the request as its argument. If [request_cb] returns true,
    the connection will proceed, otherwise, the result is immediately
    determined to [Error Exit]. *)
